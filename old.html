<!--
1. ng-app name should match with module name
2. AngularJS itself defines the global angular namespace. There are various utility
and convenience functions exposed in this namespace, and module is one of those
functions. A module acts as a container for other AngularJS managed objects
(controllers, services, and so on).

3. A module is defined now, but we need to inform AngularJS about its existence. This
is done by providing a value to the ng-app attribute as follows:
<body ng-app="hello">

4. In AngularJS there is a dedicated $provide service that allows us to register different
recipes for objects creation. Registered recipes are then interpreted by the $injector
service to provide fully-baked, ready-to-be-used object instances (with all the
dependencies resolved and injected).

5. Objects that were created by the $injector service are referred to as services.
AngularJS will interpret a given recipe only once during the application's lifecycle,
and as a result will create only a single instance of an object.

6. Values

Value objects are not particularly interesting, since object registered via this
method can't depend on other objects. This is not much of the problem for the
NotificationArchive instance, since it doesn't have any dependencies.

var myMod = angular.module('myMod', []);
myMod.value('notificationsArchive', new NotificationsArchive());


7. 
There are two ways to create a service.

    1. factory
    2.  service

Services

We can't register the NotificationsService service as a value object, since we need
to express a dependency on an archive service.
===============================================================================================
myMod.service('notificationsService', NotificationsService);

var NotificationsService = function (notificationsArchive) {
this.notificationsArchive = notificationsArchive;
};


AngularJS provides many inbuilt services for example, $http, $route, $window, $location etc.
Each service is responsible for a specific task for example, $http is used to make ajax call
to get the server data. $route is used to define the routing information and so on. Inbuilt services
are always prefixed with $ symbol.
